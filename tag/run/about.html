	<h1>YERIT!</h1>
	<h2>A video game about hillbillies and doritos by Wray Bowling</h2>

	<p>Move yer player around with that wand thing.</p>
	<p>Hay! A triangle is on you! OMG YER IT!</p>
	<p>Collect them triangles. Mmm. Tastes like doritos..</p>
	<p>You can add yer own rules but the basics are... MOST DORITOS WINS</p>

	<p>"But I don't have a triangle. What about me?" Move into a purple zone and spray soda on the player who IS IT because you want to BE IT because you LOVE DORITOS. No dang other players loves doritos as much as you.</p>

	<p>If you shoot the player who is it, you are now it! Yipee!</p>

	<p>If you are it and you get sprayed, you ain't it no more. Dang it!</p>
